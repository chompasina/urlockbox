# As an authenticated user who has added links to my URLockbox, 
# when I view the link index:
# Next to each unread link I should see an option to "Mark as Read".
# Clicking this should visibly change the read status to true, and the change should persist.
# Next to each read link I should see an option to "Mark as Unread".
# Clicking this should change the read status to false, and the change should persist.
# Read links should be stylistically differentiated from unread links. You could gray them out or use a strike through or anything you think appropriately informs the user that their link is read or unread.
